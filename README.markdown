Image Server for dynamically displaying images at any size, without distorting the image. Automatically adds padding, maintains transparency, lets you set the background/padding color to use.

**Why use it?**
Upload only 1 source file and use it for large, medium, small and thumbnails. No longer need to maintain multiple sizes of the same image.

**Usage example:**
    index.php?img=file.png&width=250&height=250

**Caution:**
*This processing these images can be slow, especially if the source file is very large. It is recommended you cache your results for better performance.*
